    <!-- seed data for your organization.  These are configured as "seed" so they would be loaded during a
    load from seed which would not include the demo data.  Comment them out if you don't need to do a seed install with 
    special seed data for your company.

    These files could be modified or expanded to fit your company's actual needs, but it is important that they are loaded
    IN THIS SEQUENCE, as there are dependencies between the files.

    The MySeedData.xml file can be used to create your own custom seed data, such as variance reasons, contact types, return reason codes,
    sales channels, etc.
